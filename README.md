# One Page Starter

## Project Description
This is a Rails 5 scaffold adopted from the free 'Agency' template available at [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/). It is intended to enhance the development of single page landing pages that demand a high standard of design and responsiveness. 

Full credit to the team at [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/) for the design and layouts. I merely repurposed the front-end for use in a Rails application for rapid deployment on future projects. 

A live version of the project has been deployed [here](http://onepagestarter.herokuapp.com/)

## Technologies 
* Rails 5.0.0.1
* Ruby 2.3.0
* Bootstrap 
* JQuery and JQuery Easing

## Future features
In future I would like to add Devise and OAuth functionality, as well as email/contact information collection capabilities.
